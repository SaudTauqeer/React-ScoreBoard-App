# React-ScoreBoard-App
A react scoreboard app using react, the css was provided to me was already pre-written. I am including the logic and react to the app.
it's currently in development phase and i plan to add more features to it along the way.
Such as the app running on a node/express server, user auth, RESTapi, mongoDB. Basically using the whole MERN stack into a fully-fledge web app.
